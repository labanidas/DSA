- Directed Graph
- Undirected Graph
- MST -  Minimum Spanning Tree
- Cycles In Graph

## Representation of graph

- Adjacency Matrix
- Adjacency List

## DFS /  BFS traversal of graph

## Detecting cycles

1. Undirected graph  —  DFS/ BFS
2. Directed Graph — DFS / BFS ( **Kahn’s Algorithm** )
    
    to detect cycles in directed graph using BFS we need to learn **TOPOLOGICAL SORTING**
